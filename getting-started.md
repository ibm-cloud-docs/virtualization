# Getting started with virtualization
{: #getting-started}

You can use the Virtualization solution to run multiple virtual machines in a single dedicated environment within {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Classic Infrastructure. Virtual machines that run on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Network can integrate with other physical and virtual devices on the network and can be managed through both the Customer Portal and API. Running virtual machines on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} proprietary architecture and automated platform offers high levels of stability suitable for enterprise-level virtualization, and virtualization on a smaller scale.
