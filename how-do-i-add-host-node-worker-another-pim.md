# Adding a host node in PIM
{: #adding-a-host-node-in-pim}

Complete the following steps to add a host node as a worker of another in PIM:

1. On the server that you designated as the Controller, go to **Infrastructure > Hardware Nodes > New Hardware Node**.
2. Enter the IP address/username(root)/password of the remote hardware node and register.

The new node resources are not immediately updated in the Controller PIM.
