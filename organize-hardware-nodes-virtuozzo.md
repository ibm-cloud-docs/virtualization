# Organizing hardware nodes in Virtuozzo

1. Go to **Infrastructure > Hardware Nodes**.
2. Clock **Add New Subfolder**.
3. Give the folder an appropriate title and select either **Folder**, **Datacenter**, or **Rack**.  In this example you create three datacenter folders within a folder. <!--Many people may then create additional folders or racks for their specific customers, should they choose to resell Virtuozzo Hardware Nodes.-->
<!--4. Review your structure and move as needed.-->
4. Return to **Infrastructure > Hardware Nodes**.
5. Select the nodes that you want to move and click **Move**.
