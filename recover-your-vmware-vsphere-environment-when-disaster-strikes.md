# Recovering your VMware vSphere environment
{: #recovering-your-vmware-vsphere-environment}

Data backup is the primary method to maintain data safety and integrity. In an ideal and perfect world, their use would never be required.  Unfortunately, the reality is that accidents and disasters do happen.  If they do, it is paramount to minimize system downtime and get back up and running as soon as possible.

In the past, storing backups on high-performance storage or tape were feasible solutions. Today, enterprises are seeking to alleviate the capital and operational costs that are associated with physical on-premises storage by augmenting or even replacing it with Object Storage. However, with Object Storage, because backups are no longer on on-premises storage, restoring from them is no longer a matter of locating the necessary backup and restoring from it. Fortunately, you can use a hybrid solution that performs much of the legwork of restoring backups that are stored on Object Storage. The solution consists of

* {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}
* NetApp AltaVault Cloud Storage Gateway from NetApp (formerly Riverbed SteelStore)
* Veeam Backup & Replication software

If a catastrophic event occurs and takes your primary environment offline, a secondary recovery site can be created within {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} to recover it. You can deploy Veeam Backup & Replication software and an AltaVault cloud-integrated storage appliance to communicate with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} to access previous backups of the primary environment. The software connects with the storage appliance to restore the backups to a new location, bringing the primary environment back online, and averting any further loss of uptime.

On-premises IP addresses are retained when you restore the virtual machines (VMs) at the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} recovery site. As a result, it is important to either change IP addresses upon successful recovery or design a BYOIP infrastructure. For assistance in either case, contact your IBM Representative.

The following procedure focuses on the coordinated use of a NetApp AltaVault Cloud Storage Gateway appliance, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure, and Veeam Backup & Replication to fully restore a VMware vSphere environment failed. The software assumes that at least one backup of the environment was made by using the three preceding technologies and is on {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} at the time of recovery.

“AltaVault appliance” is identified two different ways. The first is “on-premises AltaVault appliance,” which refers to the original, on-premises AltaVault appliance that failed and from which backups are recovered and or restored. The second is “{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} AltaVault appliance”, which refers to the AltaVault appliance that is used to recover backups from the failed on-premises AltaVault appliance. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} AltaVault appliance deploys to a vSphere environment by using a utility server.

## Introducing a Hybrid Solution
{: #introducing-a-hybrid-solution}

Veeam Backup & Replication enables a hybrid solution to include NetApp AltaVault cloud-integrated storage appliance and {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. The primary concern is to create, maintain, and restore from backups of virtual environments. The NetApp AltaVault cloud-integrated storage appliance is a software solution to seamlessly integrate an on-premises environment with private or public clouds. When used together, Veeam Backup & Replication create backups that the AltaVault cloud-integrated storage appliance stores on local, on-premises storage and simultaneously replicate onto {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. Additionally, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} pay-as-you-go pricing model and full integration with the Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers the ability to store and distribute data across 24 geographically diverse nodes.

### IBM Cloud Object Storage
{: #ibm-cloud-object-storage}

To access the data files that are backed up to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, data files are requested by the following ways:

* The AltaVault appliance already that is located on-premises
* A secondary AltaVault appliance that is located within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}

Follow this procedure to deploy a secondary AltaVault appliance within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to recover a primary, on-premises AltaVault appliance that failed.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment consists of a single ESXi host with local storage to house and run the secondary AltaVault appliance. The infrastructure is representative of the basic single-site architecture with a single ESXi host that is managed by a vCenter server within an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} virtual server instance.

If you have a more substantial infrastructure that requires shared storage and or support for these features

* vSphere High Availability (HA)
* vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)
* vSphere vMotion

#### Prerequisites
{: #prerequisites-ibm-cloud-object-storage}

Verify that the following prerequisites are met before you proceed: **Note:** For this example, a trial version of an AltaVault AVA-v8 appliance was used with AltaVault Cloud-Integrated Storage 4.1.

* Make sure that the existing environment consists of a single ESXi host that is managed by a vCenter server within an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} virtual server instance.
* Knowledge of VMware Sphere terminology and administering vSphere ESXi environments. This knowledge includes, but is not limited to, use of the vSphere web client, vSphere client, and assignment of hardware resources to include networking and storage.

#### Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-prereq}
* Navigate to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/doc/virtualization?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Ensure you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Managing classic infrastructure access](/docs/account?topic=account-mngclassicinfra) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

#### Order Two Portable Private Networks
{: #order-two-portable-private-networks}

AltaVault requires the network interfaces to be on different networks within the environment. Use the following steps to order two portable private networks through the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}.

1. Click **Account > Place an Order**.
2. Select the **Network** section click **Subnets/IPs > Order**.
3. From the drop-down menu, select **Portable Private**. Selecting Portable Private triggers an option to select the number of portable private IP addresses to display. **Note:** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automatically reserves at least three IP addresses in the address block for each portable private network. The reserved addresses are for the network address, gateway address, and broadcast address. These addresses must be bound directly to the virtual LAN (VLAN).  For more information about portable IP addresses, see [About subnets and IPs](/docs/subnets?topic=subnets-about-subnets-and-ips).
4. Click **Continue** after you select the number of portable private IP addresses.
5. Select the VLAN where the portable private IP addresses to be routed and click **Continue**.
6. Complete the required contact information and click **Place Order**.
7. Repeat the ordering process to obtain the second required portable private network.
8. Click **Network > IP Management > Subnets** from the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} page to view your portable private networks and IP addresses after they are allocated. It is recommended to track your IP address assignments. Use the **Notes** section of the **Subnets** page for each IP address to reflect the machine to which it is assigned.

#### Configuring vSphere
{: #configuring-vsphere}

You need to configure vSphere to reflect the addition of the portable private networks and make sure that they are logically segregated.

1. Go to your vSphere environment and create a virtual machine port group to reflect the addition of one of the portable IP blocks (two in total).

Virtual machine port group is labeled **Share Network**. One portable IP block is used for VMs that are placed on the default (primary) virtual machine port group. The other is used for data transfer between an AltaVault appliance and an exported Common Internet File System (CIFS)/Server Message Block (SMB) mount point.

## AltaVault Cloud Storage Gateway
{: #altavault-cloud-storage-gateway}

You can use AltaVault to integrate your on-premises environment with the cloud without the need to write scripts or applications by using REST APIs for {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. AltaVault exposes a CIFS/SMB or Network File System (NFS) mount point on the front end and securely connects to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} interface on the back end. You can then mount or point to the mount points and copy data into and or recovering/restoring environments from the cloud securely.



### Deploying AltaVault in a Disaster Recovery Configuration
{: #deploying-altavault-in-a-disaster-recovery-configuration}

Follow these steps to deploy AltaVault as a disaster recovery solution with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.

#### Before you get started
{: #before-you-get-started-deploying-altavault-in-a-disaster-recovery-configuration}

Verify that the following prerequisites are met before you proceed:

* Obtain a copy of AltaVault Virtual Appliance and make sure that it is on the utility server. It is a single file with an OVA file extension. Contact your NetApp representative for the appliance, or download a 90-day trial version from the [NetApp AltaVault website ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/altavault/docsandkb-tab){: new_window}.
* Have an existing on-premises vSphere ESXi 5.5 environment with the minimum CPU, memory, and disk space requirements available for the AltaVault appliance. If you use the trial version, these are the resource requirements: four virtual CPUs (vCPUs), 24 GB of memory, and up to 8 TB of disk space.
* Have two 10 Gbps network interface controllers (NICs) available within the vSphere environment. One NIC is used for data access, and the other is used for data replication to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.
* Have two portable private networks that correspond to the two NICs that are defined within the vSphere environment. The replication network cannot be assigned to the same network as the data access network, which can create a routing loop.
* Have {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} credentials. These credentials include an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} username, {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} username, and the API key that is associated with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} username.
* Suspend data replication on the on-premises AltaVault appliance or disconnect it from the container/bucket that is used to access the backup archive in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} if the on-premises environment is still intact.
   * Use one of the two following methods to suspend or stop replication:
      * Turn off the on-premises AltaVault appliance.
      * Go to the AltaVault appliance web management console and click **Storage > Cloud Settings > Replication**. Select **Suspend Replication**.
      * Obtain a copy of the configuration file of the on-premises AltaVault appliance or have it accessible through a URL. The configuration file is a .tar file.
   * Go to the AltaVault appliance web management console and click **Configure > Setup Wizard > Export Configuration > Export Configuration**. Save the configuration file (.tar file) and either transfer it to the utility server or make it accessible through a URL.
      * Knowledge of VMware Sphere terminology and administering vSphere ESXi environments. This knowledge includes, but is not limited to, use of the vSphere web client, vSphere client, and assignment of hardware resources such as networking and storage.

### Deploying AltaVault OVA
{: #deploying-altavault-ova-disaster}

Deploy the AltaVault OVA to the vSphere environment by using the utility server after all of the prerequisites are met. Instructions for OVA deployment can be found in the [NetApp AltaVault Installation and Service Guide ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2317733){: new_window}. The trial version of AltaVault comes configured with four virtual CPUs, 6 GB of memory, and a 150 GB primary disk. Use the Installation and Service Guide to do the following steps:

1. Increase the amount of memory to 24 GB.
2. Add a secondary disk storage device that is less than or equal to 8 TB to store deduplicated backup data.
3. Assign different portable private networks to the AltaVault appliance after the memory and disk configurations are changed.

The NICs are assigned the following interface functions:

* **Primary**: Used for the AltaVault appliance management and data replication to the cloud. It is assigned the **Primary Network** port group in the example environment.
* **e0a**: An optional interface that is used to replicate data from the AltaVault appliance to the cloud.
* **e0b**: An interface that is used to export the mount point for the SMB/CIFS or NFS share. It is assigned the **Share Network** port group in the example environment.
* **e0c**: An optional interface that is used to export the mount point for the SMB/CIFS or NFS share.

In the example configuration in this procedure, the AltaVault appliance uses the **Primary** interface as the replicate-to-cloud interface and the **e0b** interface to export a CIFS/SMB mount point. **Note:** You cannot use both A CIFS/SMB share and an NFS share to access the same data. The protocol that is used must be the same as the protocol that is used with the on-premises AltaVault appliance to replicate data to the cloud.



For more information on the deployment of the AltaVault appliance and configuration of the VM settings, see [NetApp AltaVault Installation and Service Guide ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2317733){: new_window}.

### Configuring AltaVault for IBM Cloud Object Storage
{: #configuring-altavault-for-ibm-cloud-object-storage}

The AltaVault appliance must be connected to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service after it is set up. In the on-premises configuration, the public DNS is used to connect to the Object Storage Service. In this configuration, the internal DNS name is used instead.

1. Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the AltaVault appliance.
2. Log in to the console with the admin credentials. Upon initial login, the **Wizard Dashboard** displays.
3. Select **System Settings** and verify that all network settings are correct and adjust the time zone to reflect the time zone of your environment.
4. Select **Next > Save and Apply > Exit**. You return to the **Wizard Dashboard** and are logged out of your current browser session.
5. Log back in to the AltaVault appliance and click **Settings > Setup Wizard > Import Configuration** and specify the location of the configuration file of the on-premises AltaVault appliance.
6. Select **Import Shared Data Only**, which imports only settings that are shared, such as cloud and email settings.
7. Enter the passphrase for the encryption key that is specified during the creation of the on-premises AltaVault appliance, if one was set, in the **Key Passphrase** text box.
8. Click **Import Configuration > Exit**.



You successfully imported the on-premises AltaVault appliance configuration to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} AltaVault appliance.

Use the following steps to modify the cloud settings of the {{site.data.keywrod.cloud_notm}} AltaVault appliance to give it access to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service through the private network.

1. In AltaVault, go to **Storage > Cloud Settings > Cloud** and modify the hostname to reflect the private address of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service.
   * The private network name syntax is <location>.objectstorage.service.networklayer.com, where *<location>* designates the shortened data center name (example: mel01 for the Melbourne 01 data center).
2. Click **Apply**. The AltaVault appliance attempts to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service. If this connection attempt fails, verify that the cloud provider settings are correct before you try to connect again.

After you connect to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, the appliance needs to be placed in recovery mode to sync the metadata content of the original backup data from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.

Use the following steps to place the AltaVault appliance in recovery mode.

The AltaVault appliance syncs data from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. **Note:** The time it takes to complete the sync depends on the size and number of backups that are being restored.

1. Go to the AltaVault appliance, log in, and enter the commands that are shown in Figure 3:<br/>![Figure 3](images/veeam_restore_fig5.png)<br/>`Figure 5: Recovery mode commands`
2. Return to the AltaVault appliance web console after the sync process completes.
3. Verify that the **Storage Optimization Service** is **running** and that it's **Status** is **ready**. It might take a few minutes for the **Status** to change to **ready**.

### Configure the CIFS/SMB Mount Point in AltaVault
{: #configure-the-cifs-smb-mount-point-in-altavault}

After the internal connection to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} is established, configured the **e0b** interface to access a CIFS/SMB mount point.

1. In the AltaVault web console, go to **Settings > Data Interfaces**.
2. Expand the **e0b** interface and select **Enable Data Interface**, if necessary.
3. Enter the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway that you want to use to mount the CIFS/SMB share. Make sure to use a different subnet than the one that is used for the primary interface.
4. Leave the default **MTU** value of **1500 bytes**.
   * Although the default maximum transmission unit (MTU) is 1,500, you can change it to 9,000 if you are using jumbo frames. Your ESXi host and physical infrastructure need to support jumbo frames. By default, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports an MTU size of 9,000 bytes with no configuration changes needed.
5. Click **Apply**.

The AltaVault appliance is now configured to allow communications between itself, {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, and Veeam Backup & Replication.
