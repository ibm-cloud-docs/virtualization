# Running Hyper-V in an active directory environment
{: #running-hyper-v-in-an-active-directory-environment}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-running-hyper-v-in-an-active-directory-environment}

Before you begin running Hyper-V in an active directory environment, you need the following:

* A supported 64-bit Windows server that runs Hyper-V (Full or Core installation of the OS).
* A global group on the domain that is used to manage Hyper-V.
* Domain Admin access to enable changes on the Hyper-V server from the computer that you are working from.

## Configuring the Hyper-V server
{: #configuring-the-hyper-v-server}

1. Open a management connect to the Hyper-V server.

2. Add **Hyper-V** group to the **Distributed COM Users** group.

3. Add **Hyper-V** group to the **CIMV2 and Virtualization** namespaces.

4. Add **Hyper-V** group to the Authorization store for Hyper-V on the Hyper-V server.

5. Provide the **Hyper-V** group permissions to the Hyper-V Directory on the Hyper-V server.

## Setting up remote management connection
{: #setting-up-remote-management-connection}

Make sure you are logged into a computer on the domain with Domain Admin privileges.

1. Go to **Control panel > Administrative Tools > Computer Management**.

2. In the Action menu, select **Connect to another computer**.

3. Enter the server name or IP and click **OK**.

## Adding Distributed COM Users group to the Hyper-V server
{: #adding-distributed-com-users-group-to-the-hyper-v-server}

You first need to add the Hyper-V group to the Distributed COM Users group on the Hyper-V server.

1. Go to **System Tools > Local Users and Groups > Groups > Distributed COM Users > Add to Group**.

2. Click **Add** and enter the group name for the Hyper-V group and click **OK**.

## Granting remote access to the server for CIMV2 and Virtualization namespaces
{: #granting-remote-access-to-the-server-for-cimv2-and-virtualization-namespaces}

You can update the permissions for Remote access to the server for Virtualization and CIMV2.

1. From the Computer Management window, select **Service and Applications > WMI Control**.

2. Right-click and go to **Properties > Security > Root > CIMV2 > Security**.

3. Add the Hyper-V group, then select it and click **Advanced**.

4. Make sure that the new group is selected and click **Edit**.

5. Change **Apply to:** to **The namespace and all subnamespaces**.

6. For **Enable Account and Remote enable**, make sure that **Allow** is selected.

7. Select for **Apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container only** and click **OK**.

8. Repeat these steps for Virtualization.

## Updating authorization store
{: #updating-authorization-store}

The authorization store for Hyper-V is the final component that gives domain group to Hyper-V.

1. Open the Authorization Manager by running the command `azman.msc` from the run menu or a command prompt.

2. From the Action menu select **Open Authorization Store**.

3. Make sure that **XML** is selected. Now, you need to remotely access `InitalStore.xml` on the Hyper-V server. Use the following path:

   ```
   \HOSTNAME\c$\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Hyper-V\InitialStore.xml
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Go to **Hyper-V services > Role Assignments > Administrator**.

5. From the **Action Menu**, select **Assign Users and Groups > From Windows and Active Directory**.

6. Add the Hyper-V group.

## Granting folder permissions
{: #granting-folder-permissions}

Now that the Hyper-V group has complete permissions to manage Hyper-V remotely, you need to give permissions to write to the `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Hyper-V` folder.

1. Open My Computer and go to the following address:

   ```
   \HOSTNAME\c$\Users\Public\Documents
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Go to **Hyper-V > Properties > Security**

3. Add the Hyper-V group and make sure that is has the ability to Read, Write and Execute files from that directory. In general, it is easier to assign **Full control**.

## Finalizing configuration
{: #finalizing-configuration}

All configuration changes are complete. To finalize the configuration, you need to restart the Hyper-V server. After the server is back online, connect to it from your Local Hyper-V Manager. You now have full access to manage all VMs and the Hyper-V Service.
